# Overview

This code is an Angular component that solves the **Egg Dropping Problem**. The problem is a classic exercise in computer science and mathematics, involving determining the minimum number of attempts needed to find out from which floor an egg will break when dropped, given a certain number of eggs and floors.

The component allows users to input the number of eggs and floors, calculates the minimum number of drops required, and updates the view accordingly.

## Understanding the Imports

```typescript
import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
```

### `import { Component, signal } from '@angular/core';`

- **`Component`**: This is a decorator in Angular that marks a class as an Angular component and provides metadata about the component.
- **`signal`**: Signals are a way to manage reactive state in Angular. They allow components to react to changes in data and update the view accordingly.

### `import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';`

- **`FormsModule`**: This module is necessary when working with forms in Angular. It provides directives and services that help capture user input, validate it, and respond to changes.

---

## Component Decorator and Metadata

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-eggdrop',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [FormsModule],
  templateUrl: './eggdrop.component.html',
  styleUrl: './eggdrop.component.sass'
})
```

- **`@Component({...})`**: This decorator tells Angular that the following class is a component and provides metadata.
  - **`selector: 'app-eggdrop'`**: This is the HTML tag that represents the component. You can use `<app-eggdrop></app-eggdrop>` in your templates to include this component.
  - **`standalone: true`**: Indicates that this is a standalone component, which can be used without declaring it in an NgModule.
  - **`imports: [FormsModule]`**: Specifies that this component uses the `FormsModule`, which is necessary for template-driven forms.
  - **`templateUrl: './eggdrop.component.html'`**: Points to the HTML template file for this component.
  - **`styleUrl: './eggdrop.component.sass'`**: Points to the Sass stylesheet file for this component.

---

## The `EggdropComponent` Class

```typescript
export class EggdropComponent {
  // Signals for tracking state
  eggs = signal(2);     // Number of eggs
  floors = signal(100);  // Number of floors
  drops = signal(0);     // Track number of drops

  // Function to simulate the egg drop problem
  eggDrop() {
    const eggs = this.eggs();
    const floors = this.floors();
    const result = this.calculateDrops(eggs, floors);
    this.drops.set(result);
  }

  // Calculate the minimum number of drops
  calculateDrops(eggs: number, floors: number): number {
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: eggs + 1 }, () => Array(floors + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= eggs; i++) {
      for (let j = 1; j <= floors; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = j;
      }
    }

    for (let i = 2; i <= eggs; i++) {
      for (let j = 2; j <= floors; j++) {
        dp[i][j] = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
        for (let x = 1; x <= j; x++) {
          const res = 1 + Math.max(dp[i - 1][x - 1], dp[i][j - x]);
          dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
        }
      }
    }

    return dp[eggs][floors];
  }

  // Handle input safely
  onInputChange(event: Event) {
    const inputValue: string = (event.target as HTMLInputElement)?.value || '0'; // Always a string
    this.floors.set(parseInt(inputValue, 10)); // Set signal value safely
  }
}
```

Let's go through each part of the class in detail.

---

### 1. Class Declaration

```typescript
export class EggdropComponent {
  // Class content...
}
```

- **`export class EggdropComponent`**: This declares a new class named `EggdropComponent` that can be used in other parts of the application.

---

### 2. Signals for Tracking State

```typescript
eggs = signal(2);     // Number of eggs
floors = signal(100);  // Number of floors
drops = signal(0);     // Track number of drops
```

- **`eggs = signal(2);`**
  - Initializes a signal named `eggs` with a value of `2`.
  - **Signal**: Think of a signal as a special variable that, when its value changes, automatically updates any part of the UI that depends on it.

- **`floors = signal(100);`**
  - Initializes a signal named `floors` with a value of `100`.

- **`drops = signal(0);`**
  - Initializes a signal named `drops` with a value of `0`.
  - This will store the calculated minimum number of drops needed.

---

### 3. The `eggDrop` Function

```typescript
eggDrop() {
  const eggs = this.eggs();
  const floors = this.floors();
  const result = this.calculateDrops(eggs, floors);
  this.drops.set(result);
}
```

- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum number of drops needed based on the current number of eggs and floors.

- **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

  - **Retrieve Current Values**:

    - **`const eggs = this.eggs();`**
      - Calls the `eggs` signal to get its current value.
      - **Note**: `this.eggs()` invokes the signal to retrieve the value.

    - **`const floors = this.floors();`**
      - Similarly, retrieves the current value of `floors`.

  - **Calculate Drops**:

    - **`const result = this.calculateDrops(eggs, floors);`**
      - Calls the `calculateDrops` method with the current number of eggs and floors.
      - Stores the result (minimum number of drops) in `result`.

  - **Update Drops Signal**:

    - **`this.drops.set(result);`**
      - Updates the `drops` signal with the new result.
      - This will automatically update the UI wherever `drops` is used.

### 4. The `calculateDrops` Function

```typescript
calculateDrops(eggs: number, floors: number): number {
  // Function content...
}
```

- **Purpose**: Computes the minimum number of attempts (drops) needed to determine the critical floor in the worst-case scenario.

- **Parameters**:

  - **`eggs: number`**: The number of eggs available.
  - **`floors: number`**: The number of floors in the building.

- **Returns**: A number representing the minimum number of drops needed.

#### Understanding the Dynamic Programming Approach

The function uses a method called **dynamic programming** to solve the problem efficiently.

- **Dynamic Programming**: A technique used in programming to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Explanation

##### Initialize the DP Table

```typescript
const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: eggs + 1 }, () => Array(floors + 1).fill(0));
```

- **`dp`**: A two-dimensional array (table) where:

  - **Rows** represent the number of eggs (from `0` to `eggs`).
  - **Columns** represent the number of floors (from `0` to `floors`).

- **Purpose**: `dp[i][j]` will hold the minimum number of drops needed with `i` eggs and `j` floors.

- **Initialization**:

  - Creates an array with `eggs + 1` rows.
  - Each row is an array with `floors + 1` columns, filled with `0`.

##### Set Base Cases

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i <= eggs; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= floors; j++) {
    dp[i][j] = j;
  }
}
```

- **Explanation**:

  - **When we have only one egg (`i = 1`)**:

    - We have to try every floor from the bottom up.
    - Therefore, the number of attempts equals the number of floors.

  - **Initialize all `dp[i][j]` to `j`**:

    - This assumes the worst-case scenario where we have to try every floor sequentially.

- **Nested Loops**:

  - **Outer Loop (`i` from `1` to `eggs`)**:

    - Iterates over the number of eggs.

  - **Inner Loop (`j` from `1` to `floors`)**:

    - Iterates over the number of floors.

  - **Action**:

    - Sets `dp[i][j] = j` for all combinations of eggs and floors.

##### Compute Minimum Drops Using Dynamic Programming

```typescript
for (let i = 2; i <= eggs; i++) {
  for (let j = 2; j <= floors; j++) {
    dp[i][j] = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    for (let x = 1; x <= j; x++) {
      const res = 1 + Math.max(dp[i - 1][x - 1], dp[i][j - x]);
      dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
    }
  }
}
```

- **Explanation**:

  - **We start from 2 eggs and 2 floors** because the base cases have already been handled.

- **Variables**:

  - **`i`**: Number of eggs (from `2` to `eggs`).
  - **`j`**: Number of floors (from `2` to `floors`).
  - **`x`**: The floor we're testing to drop the egg from (from `1` to `j`).

- **Steps**:

  - **Set Initial Value to Maximum**

    ```typescript
    dp[i][j] = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    ```

    - Initializes `dp[i][j]` to a very large number.
    - This ensures that any computed value will be less than this initial value.

  - **Inner Loop Over Floors (`x`)**

    ```typescript
    for (let x = 1; x <= j; x++) {
      // Compute res and update dp[i][j]
    }
    ```

    - Considers all possible floors from `1` to `j` to drop the egg.

  - **Calculate Result for Each Floor**

    ```typescript
    const res = 1 + Math.max(dp[i - 1][x - 1], dp[i][j - x]);
    ```

    - **`1 + ...`**: We add `1` because we're making one attempt by dropping the egg from floor `x`.

    - **Case 1: Egg Breaks**

      - **`dp[i - 1][x - 1]`**

        - We have one less egg (`i - 1`).
        - We need to check floors below (`x - 1`) because the egg broke at floor `x`.

    - **Case 2: Egg Doesn't Break**

      - **`dp[i][j - x]`**

        - We have the same number of eggs (`i`).
        - We need to check the floors above (`j - x` floors remaining) because the egg survived.

    - **`Math.max(...)`**

      - Takes the worst-case scenario (maximum of the two cases) because we want to minimize the maximum number of attempts in the worst case.

  - **Update Minimum Drops**

    ```typescript
    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], res);
    ```

    - Updates `dp[i][j]` with the smallest value between the current `dp[i][j]` and the newly calculated `res`.

- **Purpose**:

  - This dynamic programming approach ensures that we're always considering the strategy that minimizes the maximum number of attempts needed, regardless of how the eggs behave.

##### Return the Result

```typescript
return dp[eggs][floors];
```

- **Returns**: The value at `dp[eggs][floors]`, which is the minimum number of drops needed with the given number of eggs and floors.

### 5. The `onInputChange` Function

```typescript
onInputChange(event: Event) {
  const inputValue: string = (event.target as HTMLInputElement)?.value || '0'; // Always a string
  this.floors.set(parseInt(inputValue, 10)); // Set signal value safely
}
```

- **Purpose**: Handles user input changes for the number of floors.

- **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

  - **Retrieve Input Value**

    ```typescript
    const inputValue: string = (event.target as HTMLInputElement)?.value || '0';
    ```

    - **`event.target`**: The DOM element that triggered the event (e.g., an input field).
    - **`as HTMLInputElement`**: Type assertion to treat the target as an HTML input element.
    - **`?.value`**: The value entered by the user.
    - **`|| '0'`**: Defaults to `'0'` if the value is undefined or null.

    - **Result**: Ensures `inputValue` is always a string representing a number.

  - **Update the Floors Signal**

    ```typescript
    this.floors.set(parseInt(inputValue, 10));
    ```

    - **`parseInt(inputValue, 10)`**: Converts the string `inputValue` to an integer using base 10.
    - **`this.floors.set(...)`**: Updates the `floors` signal with the new integer value.
    - **Safety**: Using `parseInt` ensures that even if the user enters a non-numeric value, it will be converted to an integer (possibly `NaN`, but in this context, likely handled elsewhere).

---

## Summary

The component manages three key pieces of data using signals:

- **Number of Eggs (`eggs`)**
- **Number of Floors (`floors`)**
- **Minimum Number of Drops (`drops`)**

The `eggDrop` method is triggered (likely by a user action) to calculate the minimum number of drops needed based on the current eggs and floors.

The `calculateDrops` method implements a dynamic programming solution to efficiently compute the minimum number of attempts needed in the worst-case scenario.

The `onInputChange` method safely handles user input for the number of floors, ensuring the application state remains consistent.
