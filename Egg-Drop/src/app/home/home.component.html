<div class="egg-dropping-problem">
    <p>You are given two identical eggs and access to a building with 100 floors.</p>
    
    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>Determine the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.</p>
    
    <h3>Constraints:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>An egg that survives a fall can be used again.</li>
      <li>An egg that breaks on impact cannot be used again.</li>
      <li>The eggs are identical in every way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Goal:</h3>
    <p>Devise a strategy that minimizes the number of egg drops in the worst-case scenario.</p>
    
    <h3>Question:</h3>
    <p>How would you approach this problem? Please design an algorithm or strategy to determine the critical floor with the least number of drops possible, and explain your reasoning.</p>
